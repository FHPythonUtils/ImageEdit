Three example files: round.py, makeProjIcons.py and makePWAImages.py. Now includes a tracing component. Now you can make all of the SVGs! (Note capped to 180x180px to prevent hanging on test machine. And note that it will take 1-2 mins per trace at that resolution). Includes a second tracing component using js that is much faster. Takes a few seconds and has no cap.",

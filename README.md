# ImageEdit

<img src="readme-assets/icons/name.png" alt="Project Icon" width="750">

[**Now available on pypi.org!**](https://pypi.org/project/imageedit/)

Create various icon masks and shading effects with the imageedit library.
Six example files under main: round.py, makeProjIcons.py, makePWAImages.py,
makeRetro.py, getPWAScreenshots.py and readWriteLayered.py.

Leverages the following libraries to do the heavy lifting:

```none
Pillow
blendmodes
colourswatch
layeredimage
metprint
svgtrace
```

Have a look under test/test_read_write_layered for an example of converting an
xcf to ora and png. Unfortunately, visibility of xcf is currently ignored :(

## Example Files

- get_pwa_screenshots.py
- make_phone_screenshots.py
- make_poj_icons.py
- make_pwa_images.py
- make_retro.py
- read_write_layered.py
- round.py

## Comparison to similar solutions

Similar solutions include but are not limited to:

### GUI

https://www.getpaint.net/

### Web

https://realfavicongenerator.net/

### Advantages of this solution

- Lightweight: few dependencies required (python, pillow, blendmodes,
layeredimage, and svgtrace)
- Quick: when given a regular or mask image it can produce many
variants in a relatively short amount of time
- Customizable: write your own scripts to leverage imageEdit (python knowledge
required)
- Produce a PWA mask icon out of the box
- SVG tracing lib doesn't require potrace/ pypotrace which can be challenging to
set up on Windows
- SVG tracing using imageTracerJs.py (https://github.com/jankovicsandras/imagetracerjs)

### Disadvantages of this solution

- Specific image dimensions needed out of the box: whilst this is something that
could be changed, maskable icons are 640x640 and regular icons are 512x512

## How to use out of the box

### get_pwa_screenshots.py

### make_phone_screenshots.py

### make_proj_icons.py

### make_pwa_images.py

1. Put regular 512x512 image or mask 640x640 image under main/input in this
example I am using lightfox.png

	<img src="readme-assets/examples/lightfox.png" alt="LightFox" width="128">

2. Run ```make_pwa_images.py``` and navigate to main/output/lightfox.png/pwa

	</div>

### make_retro.py

1. Put regular 512x512 image or mask 640x640 image under main/input. In this
   example I am using BlendModes.png

## Documentation

A high-level overview of how the documentation is organized organized will help you know
where to look for certain things:

<!--
- [Tutorials](/documentation/tutorials) take you by the hand through a series of steps to get
  started using the software. Start here if youâ€™re new.
-->
- The [Technical Reference](/documentation/reference) documents APIs and other aspects of the
  machinery. This documentation describes how to use the classes and functions at a lower level
  and assume that you have a good high-level understanding of the software.
<!--
- The [Help](/documentation/help) guide provides a starting point and outlines common issues that you

## Building

This project uses https://github.com/FHPythonUtils/FHMake to automate most of the building. This
command generates the documentation, updates the requirements.txt and builds the library artefacts

Note the functionality provided by fhmake can be approximated by the following

```sh
handsdown  --cleanup -o documentation/reference
poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt
poetry export -f requirements.txt --with dev --output requirements_optional.txt
poetry build
```

`fhmake audit` can be run to perform additional checks

## Testing

For testing with the version of python used by poetry use

```sh
poetry run pytest
```

Alternatively use `tox` to run tests over python 3.8 - 3.11

```sh
tox
```
